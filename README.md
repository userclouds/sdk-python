Install the SDK by running
```
pip3 install usercloudssdk
```

You need to have a tenant on UserClouds to run the sample code against. Once you have the tenant information, you can try running the various samples in this repo. Update 
```
client_id = "<REPLACE ME>"
client_secret = "<REPLACE ME>"
url = "<REPLACE ME>"
```
in `userstore_sample.py`

and run:
```
python3 userstore_sample.py
```
